# Cachealots

An 8-bit stylised game where the main character is a whale: you are supposed to eat 6 squids before the sharks eat you. 

Apart from it, there is also a 1vs1 option level, where 2 players are able to play each other: in this game, the sperm whale is supposed to run away from the shark for 30 seconds. 

If you pull this one off, you win! Otherwise, you lose! 

This game was coded on Java by using the Simple Graphics library.
